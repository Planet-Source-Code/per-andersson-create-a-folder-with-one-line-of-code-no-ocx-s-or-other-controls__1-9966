### Description

Here you can make a new folder with just ONE line of code. You decide where you wanna place the folder(like 'c:\New Folder\Sub\'). You don't need any extra OCX's or other kind of controls so just take the code and enjoy it. The code is very useful to me and im sure it will be to you too.
